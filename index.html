            <h1>The story of Unus Annus</h1>
        </div>
        <h4>Once uopn a time there was a youtube channel</h4>
        <p class="text">This particular youtube channel 
            was made by two goofy guys who decided to create this channel together, their goal was to create 
            entertaining videos everyday for a year and then they would delete the channel and all it's content.
            Hence the name "Unus Annus" meaning "One year" in latin. Aside from the videos being minimum 10 minutes
            long, they also wanted to broaden their horizon of experiences and push their limits or "go even further beyond"
            as they said many times during different episodes.

            <h2>Memento Mori</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">As the channel came to life it quickly became clear that they often brought up the subject of life 
            and it's enevitable end; death. Reminding the audience that the clock was ticking ever onwards and time waits for 
            no one. This reminder was also placed in the intro and outro of each episode, accompanied by the ticking sound of the 
            clock and the numbers counting down the end of the channel itself. They added a lot of humor and made a comic bit
            about the channels death in the end of many of their episodes, after all they wanted to make people laugh, but also 
            remind them to do what they wanted to do, as they wanted their viewers to keep in mind that life is too short to wait 
            for the "proper time". And so many of their viewers took to their philosophy and saw many of their quotes, such as 
            "memento mori", "time always seems to move faster when it's running out" and so on, as personal reminders to seize the day and live life 
            to the fullest.</p>

            <h2>Theme and theories</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">This journey had a main theme of black and white, with many theories as to why, some claiming it
            meant white was life and black was death, others claiming it meant white was positive and black was negative, 
            alongside many other theories. The two guys responsible for the channel wore suits, one black, the other white, 
            as a way to step into character where they would refer to themselves as "Unus" and "Annus". Once their characters
            where established, roughly a month or two into the year, they started pinpointing the jokey bit about death to their
            characters dying.

            <h2>Lore</h2>
        </div>
            <p>While the episodes where very different in what content they contained, the theme of life, death and the never ending 
                ticking of the clock was kept in all the episodes. Some episodes would be simple challenges, such as drawing old 
                memes from memory, others would be trying new things, possibly things that are well known, but that the goofy guys themselves 
                had never tried. In one episode they would see how many hot-dogs they could eat within a set time limit, in another they 
                tried to create their own sensory deprivation chamber in a bathtub, followed by them going to an actual sensory deprivation 
                chamber to compare their own attempt to the real thing. They also went casket shopping in an actual casket and coffin shop, 
                where they designed the somewhat famous "Unus Annus coffin". </p>
